## Secure Font Picker using ArcsJs

This is a prototype implementation of a Picker API for Chrome that would allow
permission-less access to fingerprintable resources while being extensible, and
fingerprint resistant.

![](https://project-oak.github.io/arcsjs-chromium/demo/explainer/fulldemo.png)

[Live Demo](https://project-oak.github.io/arcsjs-chromium/demo/explainer/fulldemo.html)

The general mechanism for achieving our goal of non-fingerprintability is to
restrict the code that is processing the list of fonts:

* Only one font can ever be seen by the code at a time
* The code is pure functional. It can only receive inputs and return outputs. No access to writable global state is permitted.
* Rendering is done via templates. No access to DOM is permitted.
* Only a single datum, the selected font, may be returned to the host page.

Despite those restrictions, font pickers can be built with rich functionality
including arbitrary grouping, mixing of local and web fonts, search and sort
functionality, and even the ability to create and store new per-font metadata
like a personal rating or favoriting mechanism.

The full system is very flexible, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we will
only be modifying **Recipes** to customize the system.

As a demonstration of flexibility, below is a screenshot of a Lightroom-style
photo picker built using the same techniques.

![](https://project-oak.github.io/arcsjs-chromium/demo/explainer/photodemo.png)

## The Host Page

The host page is the page that will launch the font picker. This is your
application, for example, an editor application. Here you must provide a DOM
element into which the IFRAME containing the font chooser will be rendered, e.g.

```
<div id="chooser"></div>
```

<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/index.html" target="_demo">See index.html example</a>

Next you create an `app.js` file (or a name of your liking), which sets up the
request for the picker, and invokes it when desired. A picker request is
initiated by invoking `FontChooser.requestFont(request)` with a JSON object
containing the following key parameters:

* **chooser**: The root DOM element to contain the IFRAME
* **webFonts**: Additional host-page (not local) supplied fonts.
* **kind**: A reference to the **_Recipe_** file containing your custom picker
  code.

As an example

```
const FamilyRequest = {
  // custom recipe
  kind: `${local}/FontsByFamilyRecipe`,
  // custom fonts
  webFonts: fonts,
  // custom container
  chooser: window.chooser
};
```

**Note**: The `${local}` variable is just a JS variable defined in the recipe
file

<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/app.js" target="_demo">See app.js example</a>

## Recipes and Particles

Rather than delve into the workings of the recipe file, at this point, just
accept that it tells the runtime which code to load and which data it can read
and write externally. We'll loop back and explain it in more detail later.
Instead, let's examine the meat of the simplest font picker, the `LocalFonts.js`
file which is referenced by `LocalFontsRecipe.js`.

The ArcsJs system refers to code it loads from recipes as **_Particles_** and
in the font picker system, we use a special variant of these called a **_
Non-Permissive Particle_**. The key difference is that a non-permissive particle
is just a JSON dictionary of pure functions. It cannot define classes or top
level globals. As a simple example:

```
({
   add: function(a,b) { return a + b },
   mul: function(a,b) { return a * b }
})
```

We can make this look nicer with ES6 format:

```
({
  add(a,b) { return a + b },
  mul(a,b) { return a * b }
})
```

The minimum `Particle` for a font picker must specify a `render` function and
a `template` variable. Here's an example of the simplest possible
local font picker.

```
{ 
render({fonts}) {
  return {
    myfonts: {
      models: fonts,
      $template: 'font_t',
    }
  };
},

template: html`
<div>{{myfonts}}</div>

<template font_t>
  <div>
    <span flex name>{{name}}</span>
    <span sample style$="{{displayStyle}}">Sample</span>
  </div>
</template>
`
```

The `render` function is given an opaque reference to a list of fonts. This is
not an object you can iterate or inspect -- it is simply passed around the system
and expanded internally by the runtime as needed. The goal of the render
function is to return an object which associates these opaque `fonts` handles
to templates for rendering. In the example above, we return an object with
a key called `myfonts` with two properties: `models` and `$template`. _Models_
points to the input `fonts` opaque reference, and `$template` refers to a
`<template>` element which will be stamped down for each font in the
input. The `<div>{{myfonts}}</div>` triggers the application of the template to
the opaque font list. (_Note_ that in templates, double curly brace `{{x}}` is
template interpolation.)

However, there's something missing in the above example. Where do `{{name}}`
and `{{displayStyle}}` come from? That's where **_Decorator_** functions come
in.

## Decorators

A Decorator function is a pure function which maps a piece of font data into *
additional variables* for rendering. A decorator is given associated font data,
and returns a new set of variables which are to be used in later operations,
such as filtering, sorting, and rendering. Here is the simplest possible
decorator:

```
decorator(fontData) {
  return {};
}
```

This just maps the fields of the font directly to the output without change, but
it isn't very useful. A more useful example:

```
decorator({family, fullName, weight, style}) {
  const fweight = style.includes('Bold') ? 'bold' : weight;
  const fstyle = style.includes('Italic') ? 'italic' : style.includes('Oblique') ? 'oblique' : '';
  return {
    key: fullName,
    sortKey: `family`,
    name: fullName,
    displayStyle: `font-family: "${family}"; font-weight: ${fweight}; font-style: ${fstyle};`
  };
},
```

Here you see what the `{{name}}` and `{{displayStyle}}` references earlier were
pointing to. There are also two new fields,
`key` and `sortKey`. After the _decorator_ has been applied to the every item in
the font _model_, there is an implicit sort which uses the `sortKey` field as
the field to sort on. These decorator fields are merged with the font data
before the template is applied, so technically we don't need the `{{name}}`
field and reference and could have just wrote `{{fullName}}`.

In order to use a _decorator_ you must reference it in your `render` function:

```
render({fonts}) {
  return {
    myfonts: {
      models: fonts,
      $template: 'font_t',
      decorator: `decorator`
    }
  };
},
```

**Note**: References are by name, not by JS reference, because the particle code
is pure. It cannot reference global variables, including other functions in the
file.

and
its <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/2-SimpleDecoratorRecipe.js" target="_demo">recipe definition</a>.

## Filtering

Sometimes you want to apply a filter to a list in order to a subset. This is
supported, and filters are applied after _decorator_s and can utilize that data
as well. As an example, here's a filter for only _bold_ fonts to be shown.

```
filter({style}) {
  return style?.toLowerCase().includes('bold');
},
```

To use a filter, it must also be specified in the `render` function.

```
render({fonts}) {
  return {
    myfonts: {
      models: fonts,
      $template: 'font_t',
      decorator: `decorator`,
      filter: `filter`
    }
  };
},
```

<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/3-FilterBold.js" target="_demo">See a FilterBold example</a>
and its <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/3-FilterBoldRecipe.js" target="_demo">recipe definition</a>


## Event Handling

So far we can take an opaque reference to a list of fonts and apply decoration,
filtering, and rendering, but we cannot interact with a font UI. The final
piece of the puzzle is to use event handlers to allow a font to be clicked on
and returned to the _host page_.

An _event handler_ is just a function referenced by special attributes in a
template. These attributes always begin with `on-` with a suffix corresponding
to a typical _DOM UI Event_ name.

The difference between event handling in our templates and in regular Web applications
is that the DOM event data is scrubbed, and you are given an `eventlet` and
a `key` or `value` of your own choice supplied in the template. Let's look at a
simple example:

```
<template font_t>
  <div on-click="onFontClick" key="{{key}}">
    <span>{{name}}</span>
    <span style$="{{displayStyle}}">Sample</span>
  </div>
</template>

onFontClick({eventlet: {key}}, {}) {
  return {pickedFont: key};
},
```

In this sample, when the user clicks on the _DIV_ containing the
font, `onFontClick` is invoked and given an `eventlet`. This may include event
specific information, but the interesting bit for this example is the `key`
value. This comes from the `key` attribute in the `<template>`, which references
the `{{key}}` decorated model data. In our decorator above, this turns out to
be `fullName`. Therefore, this event handler returns `{pickedFont: fullname}`,
the name of the font you clicked on.

**Note**: If an event handler returns a value, this ends the choosing process,
the chooser is closed, and control is returned to the _Host Page_.

<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/4-EventHandling.js" target="_demo">See the EventHandling example</a>
and its <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/4-EventHandlingRecipe.js" target="_demo">recipe definition</a>.


## Collation

So far, we've been able to map values ("decorate"), filter values, and sort
values. But what about grouping? What if we want to group fonts by San Serif vs
Not? There's a special built-in for that too, the `collateBy` reference.
Collation creates new sub-lists of opaque fonts, grouped by the collation field.
First, let's create a "sans vs non-sans" decoration:

```
decorator({family, fullName, weight, style}) {
  const fweight = style.includes('Bold') ? 'bold' : weight;
  const fstyle = style.includes('Italic') ? 'italic' : style.includes('Oblique') ? 'oblique' : '';
  return {
    key: fullName,
    sortKey: `family`,
    name: fullName,
    displayStyle: `font-family: "${family}"; font-weight: ${fweight}; font-style: ${fstyle};`,
    sansType: fullName.includes('Sans') ? 'sans' : 'notsans',
    header: fullName.includes('Sans') ? 'The Sans' : `"The Not Sans`,
  };
},
```

In our `render` function, we specify which field to use for grouping:

```
render({fonts}) {
  return {
    myfonts: {
      models: fonts,
      $template: 'sans_not_sans_t',
      decorator: `decorator`,
      filter: `filter`,
      mysublist: {
        collateBy: 'sansType'
      }
    }
  };
},
```

Then in our template, we would write:

```
<template sans_not_sans_t>
<div>{{header}}</div>
<div repeat="font_t">{{mysublist}}</div>
</template>

<template font_t>
  <div on-click="onFontClick" key="{{key}}">
    <span>{{name}}</span>
    <span style$="{{displayStyle}}">Sample</span>
  </div>
</template>
```

**Note**: The `sans_not_sans_t` template renders either 'The Sans' or 'The Not
Sans'. Then it invokes template
`font_t` from before with ``{{mysublist}}`` which is a group of either all the
sans fonts, or all the not sans fonts. You can specify which template to use
either in the `render` function, or by a special `repeat` attribute shown here.

# Advanced Functionality

## Maintaining UI State

Sometimes in our UI we need to allow the user to customize rendering based on UI
state, like allowing the user to specify filtering. But given the way the
existing _decorator_ and _filter_ works, this doesn't seem possible. As it turns
out, these functions have extra parameters to permit referencing immutable
global state that can only be altered by event handlers. The true set of
parameters passed to the decorator looks like this:

```
decorator(modelItem, inputs, state)
```

`modelItem` is the list of font metadata fields provided by the underlying local
fonts (or web fonts). `inputs` and `state`
are specific to the *ArcsJs* system. _Inputs_ are data provided by a ArcsJs _
Store_ connected to your Particle by the _Recipe_. `state` is an object
maintained by the ArcsJs system that allows you to store and reference global
data. The ArcsJs system is reactive, so anytime `inputs` or `state` changes,
your particle is re-executed to update the UI.

Ordinarily, `state` is globally mutable and readable, however this would be
dangerous in a *Non Permissive Particle* because it could accumulate global font
data and create a fingerprint. So this 'state' variable is not modifiable by
_decorators_ and other functions in its callchain -- it is effectively frozen.

It is however, modifiable by user interaction. This can be used to create a
field for filtering fonts by name:

```
<div>Search: <input type="text" on-change="onChange" value="{{searchFilter}}"></div>

onChange({eventlet: {value}}, state) {
  assign(state, { searchFilter: value});
},

```

This will modify the `state.searchFilter` field when the user updates the
textfield, triggering the particle to be re-rendered. We can update
the `decorator` and `filter` function to use this new state field.

```

decorator({family, fullName, weight, style}, inputs, {searchFilter}) {
  const fweight = style.includes('Bold') ? 'bold' : weight;
  const fstyle = style.includes('Italic') ? 'italic' : style.includes('Oblique') ? 'oblique' : '';
  return {
    key: fullName,
    sortKey: `family`,
    name: fullName,
    myFilter: searchFilter,
    displayStyle: `font-family: "${family}"; font-weight: ${fweight}; font-style: ${fstyle};`
  };
},

filter({name, myFilter}, ) {
  return name?.toLowerCase().includes(myFilter);
},
```

The `searchFilter` variable is now destructured from the third argument
of `decorator` and stashed in the output as `myFilter`, which is picked up in
the `filter` function.

Whenever you use UI state, it's a good idea to initialize it to something. Here
we do this in a special function called `initialize` invoked on particle
startup.

```
initialize({}, state) {
    assign(state, {
      searchFilter: ''
    });
  },
```

<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/6-UIState.js" target="_demo">See a UI State example</a> and
its <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/6-UIStateRecipe.js" target="_demo">recipe definition</a>.


## Per-Item Mutable UI State

The previous section demonstrated global mutable UI state being utilized by a
filter function, but what if the user needs to update state that is associated
with each font? A typical example would be something like *favoriting* or *
bookmarking* a font. We'd want these fonts to sort to the top in a special
section, or perhaps allow the user to set a filter like "Show only favorites".

We started off this document by declaring that our functions are
pure-functional and unable to mutate global state (although they can access the
`inputs` and `state` objects). But there is one exception to this rule: **_
privateData_**. Hidden in each *modelItem* given to a `decorator` there is an
extra field, `privateData`, which acts like a memoized computation. It is an
immutable variable whose value is whatever value the function last returned.
The runtime simply hands the `privateData` object back to the function on next
invocation. A very important property of this is that
**each invocation of a decorator on an individual font has a unique
privateData**. It is a 1-to-1 mapping, and there is no ability for two model
items to mix their `privateData`.

Let's try to allow 'favoriting' fonts. First, the UI:

```
<template font_t>
  <div on-click="onFontClick" key="{{key}}">
    <span>{{name}}</span>
    <span style$="{{displayStyle}}">Sample</span>
  </div>
  <button on-click="onFavorite" value="{{privateData}}">Fav It</button>
</template>
```

**Note**: We're binding the `value` attribute directly to the `privateData`
value from the decorator.

Now update the `decorator` to use it:

```
decorator({family, fullName, weight, style, privateData}) {
  const fweight = style.includes('Bold') ? 'bold' : weight;
  const fstyle = style.includes('Italic') ? 'italic' : style.includes('Oblique') ? 'oblique' : '';
  const favorite = privateData?.favorite || false;
  return {
    key: fullName,
    sortKey: `family`,
    name: fullName,
    displayStyle: `font-family: "${family}"; font-weight: ${fweight}; font-style: ${fstyle};`,
    privateData: {
      favorite
    }
  };
},
```

**Note**: The `privateData` field is returned in the decorator, and given a
default value if it was empty before.

Now, we'd probably want to display the favorites in a separate section. We can
do that with template bound to a filter like:

```
favoriteFilter({privateData}) {
   return privateData?.favorite || false;
},

render({fonts}) {
    return {
      favorites: {
        models: fonts,
        $template: 'favorite_t',
        decorator: 'decorator',
        filter: 'favoriteFilter'
      },
      fonts: {
        models: fonts,
        $template: 'font_t',
        decorator: 'decorator',
      }
    };
  },
```

The last piece of the puzzle is how do we write the `onFavorite` method.

```
onFavorite({eventlet: {value}}) {   
    value.favorite = true;
},
```

We can also add an `onUnfavorite` method.

```
onFavorite({eventlet: {value}}) {   
    value.favorite = false;
},
```

**Note**: This is likely to change because it relies on this `privateData`
object passed in to be mutable during an event handler. Most likely, we will
change this to allow the event handler to somehow return a *new* privateData
object.

its <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/7-PerItemUiStateRecipe.js" target="_demo">recipe definition</a>.


## Composition

One of the core principles of ArcsJs is composition -- that is, computations can
be broken up into a graph of particles, connected by bindings specified in a
recipe. This explicit dataflow provides a safety mechanism wherein all of the
data that one particle can read from another can be defined by a policy in the
recipe. The power of this to provide privacy guarantees is the subject of
another document, but this mechanism also allows for UI composition through a
mechanism known as
**slots**.

### Slots

A slot is a placeholder in the UI rendered by a particle that can be filled in
by another particle. You can create a slot just by providing the slot attribute
on an element, for example:

```
<div slot="boldfonts"></div>
```

This slot can be filled by wiring up another particle's output in the recipe,
for example:

```
const BoldFonts = {
  $kind: '$local/3-FilterBold',
  $bindings: {
    fonts: 'fonts',
    pickedFont: 'pickedFont'
  }
};

main: {
  $kind: `${local}/8-Slots`,
  $bindings: {
    fonts: 'fonts',
    pickedFont: 'pickedFont'
  }
  $slots: {
    // The slot this particle's UI will be bound to
    boldfonts: {
      // The particle specification
      BoldFonts
    }
  }
}
```

So now someone can write a particle that custom renders a list of font with a
specific property (e.g. bold) and slot it into another particle that wants to
provide a section for it. In this case, we are *effortlessly* reusing the
particle we wrote earlier, `3-FilterBold.js`, to add a special section to our
picker.

**Note**: Slots are bi-directionally secure. A parent particle that provides a
slot does not have access to the UI that is rendered by the provider of the
slot, and the provider of the slot cannot access the UI into which it has been inserted.
Thus in a composed ecosystem of untrusted third party particles, UI
component data sharing is strictly controlled by the dataflow graph in the
recipe and any policies or restrictions imposed on it.

<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/8-Slots.js" target="_demo">See the Slots example</a>
and its <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-chromium/tree/main/pkg/demo/explainer/Library/8-SlotsRecipe.js" target="_demo">recipe definition</a>.


## Breaking out of the Container

There are two ways to break out of the sandboxed security model: _Services_
and _Custom Elements_. Both require explicit trust because they will be given
the full power of the Javascript environment. Typical examples of _Services_ are
those they need to access the network, use Web APIs, or run beefy libraries
like *Tensorflow*. The Photo Picker prototype for example, uses a service to
read _EXIF_ metadata from an image for display.

_Custom Elements_ are normally used when you need rendering power not provided
by built-in template markup. Examples of this include rendering to Canvas or WebGL, or using third
party custom elements that might encapsulate things like embedded YouTube
players, Maps, etc.

**_Not Written Yet_**
See [How to write Services](services.md)
and [How to write Custom Elements](customelements.md) for more information.

### Services

For now, let's utilize a pre-existing service that's been written for us. The
simplest service to use is Geo-Location, which we will use to pick suggested
fonts based on your geo-location.

Services in ArcsJs are based on *asynchronous message passing*. You may send an
arbitrary JSON object to a service, specified by a `kind` field of the name of
the service, and usually by convention a `msg` field specifying the name of the
method on the service you'd like to invoke, which returns a `Promise` that is
fullfilled with the return value of the service.

On particle startup, you are given a reference to a `service` function, which
you can store (e.g. in the provided `state` object) and use for later.

```
initialize({}, state, {service}) {
    assign(state, { service });
},
```

Now we might want to define a helper function for geo-location:

```
async reverseCoords(coords, service) {
    return await service({kind: 'GeoLocation', msg: 'reverseCoords', coords);
},
```

This service would convert a location specified by `coords` into an object
containing fields like `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`.

We could then do interesting things with it, like show fonts that are specific
to a locale (eg "San Francisco" font for San Francisco, or Chinese fonts if you
are located in China.)

## Other Topics

The complete runtime behind the picker, *ArcsJs*, offers far more powerful
idioms for computing not discussed or exposed here. ArcsJs has an underlying
storage system based on CRDTs. It is not browser/DOM specific and abstracts
away rendering surfaces to support arbitrary device outputs. It includes a
privacy policy model for verifying data flows in recipes. These mechanisms open
up additional integration points for applications, like tying ArcsJs Stores to
application stores or native browser stores. Custom surfaces could be used in
applications that might need to control rendering in custom ways, like a font
editor that needed to display actual font outlines. The sky's the limit.

# Appendix: Q&A

## Why ArcsJs?

You may be asking, what's all of this ArcsJs stuff and why are we using it,
instead of just handling the user a simple library function or custom web
element?

The ArcsJs team has been exploring computing concepts around composing
untrusted third party code safety via application of privacy policies, dataflow
analysis, and isolation mechanisms. We have an existing codebase that enables us
to rapidly prototype solutions like those shown here with flexible
security properties.

While it is true that a simpler API could be built on top of ArcsJs to hide it
from the end user, it would also hide some of the power available. Since we
don't know yet how much flexibility various use cases may desire, this explainer
documents the stack in greater detail.

However, it is not required that all of this complexity is exposed, and a simpler
wrapper can be designed, depending on what users want.

## What security guarantees does ArcsJs provide?

### Isolation

ArcsJs isolates both Javascript and UI.

Javascript is run in a locked down environment with most capabilities removed,
with a goal toward defense in depth. The initial layer can be run inside of an IFRAME or a
Worker or Worklet. The second layer of isolation is running JS in an environment
like SES or FrozenRealms/ShadowRealms. And the third layer is sanitizing the
Javascript to consider of only pure-top level functions, with no capability to
mutate global state.

Likewise, for UI, there are layers of protection. All UI rendering is done
through the template system, with no access given to things like DOM, and
no direct access to events. Surfaces are isolated through both IFRAMEs and
ShadowDom layers. Additional filtering may also be done to limit what elements
and/or CSS can be used.

In addition, the **Slot** system allows two untrusted 3rd party pieces of code
to be composed together in UI without being able to known anything about the UI
each other has rendered.

### Dataflow Analysis and Privacy Policy Enforcement

There is ongoing research in ArcsJs-affiliated teams on reasoning about
dataflow graphs and providing policy enforcement. What this means is that
particle outputs might have claims or types associated with them, and after
they are assembled in a dataflow graph, the system may assert checks that some
claims hold or do not hold. As an example, specific to the font case, a given
local font might be safe to egress, if it is known to be among an extremely
common group of fonts everyone has installed, thus providing no entropy. The
system could provide a 1st-party *trusted particle* which can return a list of
such fonts with such a claim.

These fonts can then be mixed-and-matched into a complex font recipe, which
could contain particles that egress fonts to a remote service call, so long as
the inputs to the particle that uses this service are checked to have this
common-font egress property.

See [Raksha](https://github.com/google-research/raksha) for more on
research in progress.

## Particles

Particles are the foundation of ArcsJs - understanding how to use and work with
them is critical to developing projects with ArcsJs. To begin, we present the
following definition of a particle.

> Particle - Modular component of functionality that is run in isolation.

Particles work asynchronously (they may receive input and send output at any
time) and can operate on data through stores (explained below). The simplest
Particle acts like a function. More complex Particles can generate UX
experiences and manage entire applications.

Each particle must declare it's expected input and output types and is only
allowed to read and write in accordance with this declaration. The particle can
only interact with the external world through supervised services. This is what
enables the isolation to ensure user privacy.

## Stores

Stores are where particles can access (input/output) data. We present a
definition of a store below.

> Store - managed location where data can be sent and/or retrieved.

Each store must declare the type of data it expects; this could be a primitive
type (int, char, etc.) or a user-defined type (Address, Name, etc.). Stores can
also be setup for a single item or a collection.

## Recipes

Recipes are the "glue" that holds particles and stores together. We present a
definition of a recipe below.

> Recipe - a description of components that allows for instantiation.

Within a recipe, particle inputs/outputs are declared and stores are defined.
This allows ArcsJs to instantiate your project and connect the correct stores
to particles.

## Surfaces

Surfaces allow for interaction (input/output) between ArcsJs and the real
world. We present a definition of a surface below.

> Surface - a primitive ArcsJs component that can render audio/visual and map
> inputs from sensors.

Surfaces can be run on different devices (phone, watch, smart speaker, etc.) and
render templates visually or auditorily based on the device's features and
user's preferences.

Surfaces are more primitive than particles. Particles often have a surface, but
they are not required to have one.

## Slots

Slots allow ArcsJs components to delegate functionality. We present a
definition of slots below.

> Slots are locations where particles or surfaces can be connected.

Within a recipe, slots allow components like particles to provide space for
other components. This could be used when a particle wants to have another
surface render or to bring in another recipe with additional functionality.
